## Images:
- **Start with Trusted Sources**: Use official container images as they undergo continuous maintenance and security audits. Obtain them from reliable sources.
- **Verify Signatures**: Before deployment, confirm the integrity of container images and ensure they are signed.
- **Image Scanning**: Scan images using image scanning software to identify vulnerabilities, malware, and configuration issues.
- **Image Hardening**: To minimize potential attack surfaces, remove unused components, services, and packages from container images.

## Registries:
- **Access Controls**: Apply strict access controls to container registries to restrict who can upload and download images.
- **Use Private Registries**: Consider using private container registries to regulate image distribution and access.
- **Enable Authentication**: Make authentication necessary to prevent unauthorized access to the registry.

## Deployment:
- **Limit Privileges**: Avoid running containers as root. Always use user accounts with minimal privileges.
- **Isolation**: Utilize container orchestration tools to keep containers isolated from each other and the host system.
- **Network Segmentation**: Implement network policies and firewalls to manage traffic between containers and pods through network segmentation.
- **Runtime Protection**: Use runtime security solutions to monitor suspicious activity and security risks in containers.

## Host and Runtime:
- **Protect the Host Operating System**: Regularly patch and update the host operating system to address vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Implement Access Controls**: Use access controls and authentication procedures to prevent unauthorized access to the host system. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication and strong password policies to enhance security.
- **Monitor Host Activity**: Employ host-level monitoring to detect unusual or suspicious activities. Threats can be identified with intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
- **Apply Hardening Practices**: Follow recommended host hardening techniques to reduce the attack surface. Minimize potential points of exploitation by disabling unused services and features.
- **Regular Backups**: Ensure periodic backups of critical host data. Having backups is beneficial in the event of a security incident or system breach.

## Containers:
Usage:
- **Use Lightweight and Ephemeral Containers**: Opt for lightweight and short-lived containers to reduce the attack surface.
- **Adopt Minimal Images**: Use simple base images to decrease the attack surface of containers.
- **Single-Process Containers**: Create containers that execute only one process to reduce complexity and security risks.
- **Short-Lived Containers**: Encourage the use of short-lived containers to minimize exposure to hazards.
- **Container Activity Monitoring**: Enable container-level logging to record activities and security incidents.
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate container logs in a centralized system for analysis through centralized logging.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring to promptly identify and respond to security incidents.

## Secrets:
- **Securely Distribute and Preserve Sensitive Data**: Establish a robust secrets management solution to distribute and safeguard sensitive data securely.
- **Encrypted Secrets**: Encrypt secrets in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Role-Based Access**: Implement role-based access control to limit who has access to secrets.
